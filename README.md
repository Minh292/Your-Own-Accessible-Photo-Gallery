# Your-Own-Accessible-Photo-Gallery
The goal of the final project is to create your own accessible, interactive photo gallery. Building on concepts you have been learning in the course you will create your own HTML file with images and alternative text and then add the code to call functions to react  to common events such page loads, mouse movement, and keyboard access.  In addition to reusing the functions from the earlier homework you will want to write code to automatically add the tabindex attribute to your figures.

Throughout the process make sure to validate your code on W3, Wave, and aXe.

Once you have completed your assignment you will complete peer reviews.  Because there are two or three challenging components to this assignment I hope  you will learn from seeing the different approaches.
